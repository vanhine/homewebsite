This is a passport book I made that holds 3 passports. It was the night before we were leaving for Scotland, I got hyperfocused on making a passport book to keep our passports safe on the trip. I designed it based around our 3 passports and while the fit is pretty tight, this made sure it was basically as small as it could be. It fit perfectly in our travel pouch and even was able to fit some bills behind the passports.
