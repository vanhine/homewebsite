I got jealous of the
 [sheath I made for my brother](https://adamvanhine.com/leather/luke-sheath/)
so I decided to make myself a matching one. I have had this really nice Lamson
vegetable cleaver (Brad Leone signature) living in an oven mit on my counter
for a few years now. The fit on this one is really nice, I left a little more
room on this one after learning a few lessons from my last. Taylor suggested
the notch for the handle to sit perfectly into and that turned out to be my
favorite part. Thanks Tay!
