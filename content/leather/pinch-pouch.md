I got myself some of squeeze frames from Tandy and wanted to make some squeeze pouches. I made this little pouch for my kid using some really beautiful tiedie lambskin leather. She keeps all sorts of treasures in there.

I also got the idea to make some sunglasses case with this. I really like the concept, but the execution here is not great. The size is completely off, and I didn't skive the edges nearly enough. I think if I pick up more squeeze frames I will try to do this project right.
