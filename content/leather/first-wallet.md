This was the first wallet I ever made! And a collection of my very early practice. I initially got interested in leather work during the COVID-19 pandemic, through watching process Youtube videos with my wife. My wife actually was the most interested in trying it initially and so we went to [Tandy Leather](https://tandyleather.com/pages/tandy-leather-fremont-17) in Fremont, CA. Our first haul was a half side of utility leather, an exacto knife with blades, some stitch punches, and thread which cost ~$200. I remember thinking we spent way too much!

I was really inspired by [Corter Leather](https://www.youtube.com/c/CorterLeather) initially and used some of their templates to get started.
