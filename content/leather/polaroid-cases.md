I made these two polaroid cases to hold our polaroid photos that were splayed out on the living room table. The first one, I got off a stitch and you can see it is a bit crooked, but it still gets the job done. The black one is much more symmetrical and I made the gussets a bit larger. I really like the black with the blue thread, gonna use that more in the future.
