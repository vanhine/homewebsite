I made this clone of a great wallet design by Lost Duchman Leather. I really
enjoy their designs and wanted to see if I could recreate their version of the
Big Finn wallet. https://www.lostdutchmanleather.com/products/the-big-finn

It turned out so good in my opinion! I love how it feels, and
it holds so much more than my standard card holders. As always, I love repping
the brown leather with red stitches, such a nice combo.
