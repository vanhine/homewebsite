I had a random idea of creating a copper filled leather bracelet. I originally
wanted to make these for my wife, but I think they came out very masculine. I
actually like how they look though and have been wearing them every now and
then. I don't really pull off bracelets though IMO. Please let me know if you
have any ideas on how to make them look a little more fancy.

I got the copper for the core from Home Depot as a copper sheet. When adding
the core, I tried not to actually glue it down and instead have it somewhat
floating. I would like to improve the rounding and the edges.
