This project is my largest project to date and it took so long to complete, but I am really happy with how it came out. This is an original design, which is probably why it is my favorite I have made. I simply looked at the basic idea for how these patterns go, and then prototyped with paper. I got a bit lazy and couldn't bring myself to stitch the handles. In my future projects I will take some extra time on it because I think it really makes a difference in the quality feel.
