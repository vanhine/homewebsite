I originally made this for my wife's phone but my daughter quickly claimed it
as her pen pouch. I was really just using this one as a way to test my gussets.
I actually really liked working with the tie die sheep skin for the gussets. It
was really soft and flexible which worked great for the gussets. I think the
gusset could have been a bit bigger, but its nice and sleek how it is.
