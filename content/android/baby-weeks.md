Baby Weeks is a super simple widget for Android that simply tells you how old your baby is, in weeks.

When I had my first kid, I realized you really measure time in weeks when your kid is first born. This app helped me remember how many weeks old they were. Really helpful honestly.

I really enjoyed working on a widget. I love that I haven't touched it since 2019 and it still looks really modern and works well.

It is currently not listed on the Play Store, however I may try to update it and get it on the store some day.
