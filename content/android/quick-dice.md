Quick Dice gives you a dice in your quick tiles. You click it to roll, you get a number. If you long press on the tile you get to the settings which allow you to set how many sides are on the dice.

This one was recently removed because I didn't have a form submitted or something so technically not beaned, but removed. I am working on getting it back up.
