Dead Cells Companion is an app that tells you all the information about items from the game Dead Cells.

It is my most complex app, involving a backend that scrapes the Dead Cells Wiki daily, updates a Firestore database which in turn is what gets displayed on the app. The app architecture is MVVM and uses Hilt for dependency injection.

My goal was to get 100 downloads for this, so I even set up a little Google Ads campaign and actually got up to 500 downloads! I believe I peaked at 30 monthly active users, and around 8 daily active users. I was really proud of making this one and even started to respond to users reviews and requests, the most common request was for translation.

Then around June 2022, Google decided to take down the app for impersonation. My app displayed the same information as other apps on the app store such as [Dead Cells Guide](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joel.deadcellswiki&hl=en_US&gl=US). This app has the same artwork and information and even uses Dead Cells in the name, and is not associated with the official developers. So I am really not sure why mine qualified for impersonation.

I emailed the devs, and did the appeal process, even changing the name of the app and resubmitting to the app store (even though I would be starting from 0 and the users of my old app would have no idea about the new app). Anyway, I am ranting now. I keep saying I want to go back and get it back on the app store, but idk if it is worth it at this point.
