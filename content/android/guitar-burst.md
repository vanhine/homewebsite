Guitarburst is the Android application version of https://www.guitarburst.com/, which has a large database of classical guitar pieces with notes and data on their difficulty levels. This is a resource for choosing new classical guitar pieces and I personally use it often!

I figured out how the website database was structured and was able to scrape all of the data using python.

The folks over at https://www.guitarburst.com/ are great, I reached out to them and they gave me permission to release this app on the app store.
