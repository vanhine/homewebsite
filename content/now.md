Welcome to my [/now](https://nownownow.com/) page! This is some of the stuff I
 am into right now.

## Projects

### Personal Website
I have taken some time to work on this website recently. Added the Fediring,
this now page, etc. https://github.com/vanhine/homewebsite

### Leather Knife Sheath
My brother's birthday was recently and I made him a leather sheath for his
birthday. It was a really fun project and definitely has me wanting to do
more leatherworking soon. https://adamvanhine.com/leather/luke-sheath/

### Nonogram Editor
I am still plugging away at writing a Nonogram editor using Bevy. I am working
on getting rendering working still, so early times. Looking forward to working
on it more.

## Music

I have been trying to pick up my Classical again, trying out Bouree in E minor
by Bach. 

I jammed a bunch at Bluegrass First Class festival in Asheville, NC. Picked up
a bunch of songs I want to play more:
- East Tennessee Blues
- East Virginia Blues
- Old Spinning Wheel
- EMD

Listening to kinda the same old stuff, looking for new music always but in a
rut.
